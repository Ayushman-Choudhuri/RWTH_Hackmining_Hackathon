# RWTH_Hackmining_Hackathon

## Problem Statement: 

It is crucial to know the wear status of mining excavator track drives, because that helps to avoid costly unplanned downtime. To improve the current situation of risky and time-consuming manual geometric measurements, a concept of an automatic wear monitoring has been developed, that aims for detecting the wear during regular operation. As a proof of concept, a few hundred events were measured on a 550t-excavator and manually analyzed. Depending on the operating conditions, evaluation of different physical effects visible in sensor data allows conclusions to the current wear of the track drive. The task is to design an automatic algorithm to estimates the wear by evaluating the course of signals. To achieve that, signal analysis and feature extracting using python libraries are applied.
